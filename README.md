# covid
The repositorium contains a Matlab file to simulate the state of advancement of the Covid-19 epidemic in the uploaded country. To do this at the moment, you need to load data from CSSE JHU resources, in particular the Confirmed matrix and prepare it in the form of an m-file named, e.g. Confddmmyyyy. To this m-file should be copied data from the Confirmed CSSE matrix for all countries and dates and named as the Conf matrix.
Conf variables are used in the covidGH m-file.
